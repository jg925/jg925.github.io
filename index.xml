      <description>Welcome! Welcome to my new personal website and blog, where I will post updates related to my career goals, life goals, and other interesting thoughts that deserve a special place.
I plan to publish reflections, opinions, and other pieces that I sometimes will choose to cross-post on LinkedIn or Medium.
I started building this site about 2 years ago, and I am SO happy that it is finally setup and finished.</description>

      <description>Hello! My name is Jinny Gui, and I am a senior undergrad at Cornell University. I study Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and minor in Computer Science (CS). My interests lie within robotics, computer vision, automation, and a general passion for efficiency and social good through a variety of different projects. Although I have done 3 summers of research with the Computer Systems Laboratory, I am now focused on industry and directly impacting the world around me.</description>
