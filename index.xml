      <title>Being Colorblind-Friendly</title>

      <description>Brief Updates If you have not yet seen my OCaml Tetris game, please check it out here! It caters to all four colorblind color palattes.
Accessibility Settings Designing games and other screen-based technologies to be colorblind-friendly is an accessibility setting that is often overlooked. If you go to your phone&amp;rsquo;s accessibility settings these days, you will often find Text-to-speech capabilities or other adjustments to font, like size, as some of the most basic options.</description>

      <title>OCaml Tetris</title>

      <description>Description During the fall semester of my senior year, I took the class CS 3110 (Functional Programming). This course aimed to teach the fundamentals of functional programming through the language OCaml. OCaml isn&amp;rsquo;t the most popular and well-documented language, but when compared to Haskell, the other popular functional programming language, it is more beginner-friendly.
For the final project, I was able to team up with 2 other classmates who were also fellow members of the BRMB (Big Red Marching Band), and we decided to recreate the game Tetris using OCaml.</description>

      <title>New Project Section! &#43; Updates</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now added a project section to the website, accessible here!
Currently, it only has the maze mapping robot project from a course I took at Cornell University in Fall 2019, but it will have 2 more old projects before I add any future projects.
I&amp;rsquo;m also considering writing a blog about why neural network report cards should be mainstream and an industry standard. This topic was inspired by one of the papers that was introduced during a TA lead lecture of the NLP course I took this past fall semester.</description>

      <description>Description Fall 2019, I took the required course for ECE majors: ECE 3400 Intelligent Physical Systems. This was my first college level robotics course since taking one trimester of robotics at my high school, NCSSM. After filling out a survey for team placement, I was grouped with 3 other students in my lab section, a 3-hour Monday evening lab at 7:30 P.M. We worked very well together as a team of four.</description>

      <description>Welcome! Welcome to my new personal website and blog, where I will post updates related to my career goals, life goals, and other interesting thoughts that deserve a special place.
I plan to publish reflections, opinions, and other pieces that I sometimes will choose to cross-post on LinkedIn or Medium.
I started building this site about 2 years ago, and I am SO happy that it is finally setup and finished.</description>
