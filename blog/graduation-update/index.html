<h2 id="plans-for-meng">Plans for M.Eng</h2>
<p>Although pre-enroll for the fall semester has not started, I am planning to take courses in Graphics, Computer Vision (at the grad level), Robot Perception, and Artificial Intelligence. I will also be completing a project that works with Computer Vision. The project is still TBD.</p>
<h2 id="summer-happenings">Summer Happenings</h2>
<p>Since graduating, I am currently working with Inspirit AI teaching AI curriculum to high schoolers. Education is something that I am passionate about ever since taking a Science Communications course last fall (Fall 2020). Teaching is one of the best ways to learn and reinforce knowledge, so I aim gaining a lot from this experience. Not just a review of various aspects of ML/AI, but also soft skills that allow me to communicate complex topics to a more general audience. It has also been fun to meet a lot of very passionate AI (undergrad and grad) students.</p>
