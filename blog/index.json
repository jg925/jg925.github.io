        "body": "Introduction I had this rant stored in my head for the past 7 months or so \u0026ndash; a rant that formed in my head as I was being a stressed student during a raging pandemic locked in my room trying to do work and watch lectures on Zoom. It was Winter Break of my senior year of undergrad. I had just finished an influential Fall semester\u0026rsquo;s worth of classes and was heading into the start of what would become a very tough and stressful Spring. I was reflecting on the past 4 years of my college career and thought about how much I had learned, not learned, and the wisdom I had gained.\nPains My 4 years at Cornell were nothing short of stressful. I entered my freshman year with a confidence unrivaling that of an arrogant high school senior. My high school experience at NCSSM had made me very confident in my abilities to live in a residential environment on my own. Dorm life was something I was already used to \u0026ndash; I had lived with 2 different roommates during my 2 years at NCSSM and knew what to look for when choosing a roommate, so I was confident that I would adjust well to Cornell. In addition to being comfortable with dorm life, I had already made the decision to join the Big Red Marching Band, and subsequently avoided any and all interaction with recruitment efforts after making the decision in April while visiting during Cornell Days.\nFall semester, I eased in to my academic life. I took 4 courses worth 16 credits. MATH 1920 (Multivariable Calculus), PHYS 1112 (Mechanics), ENGRI 1101 (Intro to Operations Research), an FWS (Freshman Writing Seminar). My first semester was a breeze. The two technical core classes I took were courses covering material that I had learned in high school. I even managed to get an A+ in Physics, which allowed me to finish off strong with a semester GPA of 3.5, placing me on the Dean\u0026rsquo;s List that semester.\nWhen it came time to pre-enroll for spring semester classes, I was riding the high from fall semester and still carrying over the confidence from NCSSM. I decided to do something known as \u0026ldquo;chem-physing\u0026rdquo;. This essentially just means taking a chemistry and physics course simultaneously. As such, I enrolled in CHEM 2090 and PHYS 2213, both courses for which I have covered in high school as well. (If I had received 5s on the APs for Chemistry and both parts of Physics C, I would have been able to skip these courses.) If I had just taken those 2 core technical courses, I would have been fine that semester. However, even though I was able to take a break with the engineering math sequence, I told myself, \u0026ldquo;I want to get ahead. I can handle this\u0026rdquo;, and also signed up for MATH 2930 (Differential Equations). What ended up happening that spring was a course load of 5 courses that would make me regret my decisions and lead me to withdraw from the math course leaving a W on my transcript.\nIt was my first \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo; in college. It was my first \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo; in school. I had not met the expectations I had set for myself and felt like the most idiotic person ever. \u0026ldquo;Why did I think this was a good idea?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Why did I let myself take 3 hard classes at once?\u0026rdquo; I kept beating myself up over this decision. I knew I was fine and was still on track to graduate, but I was worried about the effect of a \u0026ldquo;W\u0026rdquo; on my transcript. I even made a throwaway account on Reddit to post to r/Cornell just to ease my worries.\nMy freshman year definitely humbled me. However, it didn\u0026rsquo;t stop me from being stubborn and taking too many interesting and hard classes all at once. My next low point in my college career comes during my sophomore spring. At that point I had been doing research with Prof. Zhiru Zhang in the CSL for almost 1 year and was affiliated with the ECE major. Due to the nature of my academic interests, I almost couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop myself from signing up for the scheduled I did. I don\u0026rsquo;t really regret this schedule, but there were definitely some improvements I could have made that would have better helped me succeed.\nHere were the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; classes I took: ECE 3140 (Embedded Systems), ECE 3150 (Into to Microelectronics), MATH 2940 (Linear Algebra), ECE 2200 (Signals and Systems), and for S/U, AAS 1100 (Intro to Asian American Studies).\nNothing wrong with that schedule \u0026ndash; aside from perhaps the fact that Embedded Systems and Microelectronics were perhaps the hardest ECE courses to take together, combined with the ineffective professor I had in Signals. This was the semester that fully allowed me to finally accept that I was just going to be an average student at Cornell. Why? Because I finished the semester with 3 C-range grades. It was an ocean semester.\nThe following two years after my sophomore year were about as good as they could get while doing school during a pandemic. The spring semester of my junior year was stressful, but saved by the pandemic and the allowance of no-penalty S/U course grades. My senior year was average, although my last spring semester was rough due to my decision to pursue an early M.Eng (Master of Engineering), and again, being stubborn and taking too many hard and interesting classes at once. Although, this time, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t as disappointed and sad about my grades. I definitely feel like the pandemic made it much harder to collaborate with friends and classmates, and thus, made it harder for me to succeed in class. I was fine with the outcome. I passed all my classes and successfully graduated.\nGains While my 4 years were painful and stressful, I definitely gained a lot during my college experience. I will focus on my academic gains in this blog post and will not cover the social and personal gains.\nAs I have already mentioned, I was an ECE major. My undergrad degree is focused on hardware. However, as I pursued my undergraduate research experience, I eventually came to fall in love with Machine Learning and AI \u0026ndash; specifically Computer Vision. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t good at it, and it definitely took quite a long time tackling the learning curve (as is the nature of joining any research project), but it was something that I constantly looked forward to learning. This newfound interest sparked my determination to take more CS classes and eventually finish a CS minor.\nThere was a time between my sophomore and junior year when I did consider switching and becoming a CS major. However, at that time, I was still wishy-washy in which direction I wanted to go, and was afraid of the difficulty of the proof-based classes in the CS department that I would have been required to take. Hence, I decided to stick with finishing my major and instead using the M.Eng program as a way to finish my 4.5 years of college education with something equivalent to that of a CS + ECE double major.\nOne notable semester of my undergrad was Fall 2020. I point this out specifically because I ended up taking 3 very fun and enjoyable humanities courses for which I used to finish my Liberal Studies requirement. One of them was COMM 3020, a Science Communication course. This was a very interesting class that allowed me to learn many different types of writing styles (blogposts, feature articles, etc.) and become aware of the importance of effective science communication. This actually would eventually spark my interest in tech education \u0026ndash; which leads me to my current summer instructing job working with Inspirit AI.\nFinal Thoughts Looking back, I definitely think that my 4 years in undergrad helped me find the direction I wanted to go. By the summer before my senior year, I recognized that I wanted to live a fulfilling life \u0026ndash; one marked either by job satisfaction or by social satisfaction. I could thrive off of one or the other \u0026ndash; either with fulfilling work and a mediocre life or with a fulfilling life and mediocre work. I think that my journey to where I currently am, a fulfilling summer of instructing work and a curious social life, I am quite satisfied.\nLooking forward towards my M.Eng fall semester, I am quite excited to begin my full-time job search. I am fully aware that the fall semester will be tough and that the job search will be stressful at times, but I also have a very clear goal in mind that I want to reach by the end of December. These past weeks have given me the motivation to push through and face my fears.\n"

Since I am sticking around for another semester to pursue and finish an M.Eng, I will be returning to school in August.\nI have updated my biography and front page matter to reflect this change.\nPlans for M.Eng Although pre-enroll for the fall semester has not started, I am planning to take courses in Graphics, Computer Vision (at the grad level), Robot Perception, and Artificial Intelligence. I will also be completing a project that works with Computer Vision. The project is still TBD.\nSummer Happenings Since graduating, I am currently working with Inspirit AI teaching AI curriculum to high schoolers. Education is something that I am passionate about ever since taking a Science Communications course last fall (Fall 2020). Teaching is one of the best ways to learn and reinforce knowledge, so I aim gaining a lot from this experience. Not just a review of various aspects of ML/AI, but also soft skills that allow me to communicate complex topics to a more general audience. It has also been fun to meet a lot of very passionate AI (undergrad and grad) students.\n"

        "body": "Brief Updates The 2021 Spring semester has started, and it\u0026rsquo;s been 2 full weeks of classes already. I\u0026rsquo;m finally enrolled in all of the classes I want \u0026ndash; a healthy mix of robotics, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\nAnd since the new semester has started, there have been a bunch of webinars that have been hosted by various departments within my university. In one specific email of the Cornell Chronicle, I saw that there was going to be a webinar with former Republican Governor and Presidential Candidate, John Kasich. Personally, I\u0026rsquo;m more left-leaning and independent, but I do like listening to a variety of perspectives and think that hearing from politicians directly is more informative than through the filtered lens of media.\nThe First Impression Going into this webinar, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting much. I thought I would be casually tuning in and focusing on my coursework. However, shortly after the introductions, I was immediately interested and engaged in the conversation.\nThis entire webinar surrounds itself with 2 main ideas, spirtuality and focusing on solving issues at the local level. I will be going into these 2 ideas separately and how they can come together to solve different types of problems.\nSpirituality Spirituality is something that is often mistaken as religion. The two are indeed connected, but they are not the same. Spirituality is about the belief and the focus on self and bringing the self to peace. Religion is the way one engages in spirituality and is often tied to an identity (i.e \u0026ldquo;I am Christian/Jewish/Muslim\u0026rdquo;).\nAlthough Kasich specifically focused on Christianity and Judaism in his talk, he also mentioned that other religions could work as well. In any case, this is understandable because he is more experienced with the Western religions. Kasich also never failed to mention that the ones who claim to be the most religious are often the ones who are being the most polarizing and negative, and not practicing \u0026ldquo;true religion\u0026rdquo;. This seemed important because it is important to recognize that we are all humans, and everyone has the ability to control their own actions. It is also important to recognize that not everyone is perfect. \u0026ldquo;None of are gonna be saints.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen I listened to Kasich\u0026rsquo;s words during the webinar, and his focus on a \u0026ldquo;return to religious faith\u0026rdquo; as a way to create unity, I thought about my recent experience with spirituality and meditation. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading into the aetheistic side of Hiduism/Buddhism, and it\u0026rsquo;s brought me a lot more awareness and peace. I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call myself religious in any sense, but I am spiritual and have a different way of life than I had before.\nThe type of problems that spirituality can solve are ones that are interpersonal. Whether it be meditation or through prayer, there is the opportunity to sort through one\u0026rsquo;s thoughts internally and process emotions. There is research that supports that meditation is can help reduce suffering in cancer patients, and with the increase in mental health issues, spirituality seems to be able to help people find a sense of purpose and direction.\nProblem Solving at A Local Level This may seem like the obvious place to start when trying to tackle a large problem. As the Confucious saying goes, \u0026ldquo;The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying small stones.\u0026rdquo; What this means is that for all of the large and wicked problems, climate change, poverty, the problem solving starts at a small scale. Of course, in the age of globalization and the ability to communicate with anyone and travel to anywhere around the world, it is helpful to have larger systems to support the local efforts. However, the most impact is created locally.\nThis part of Kasich\u0026rsquo;s webinar focused on telling the students who were in attendance to go out and solve a local problem with friends. When people are focused on solving the same issues, there is an opportunity to bond and differences, political and ideological, go out the window. Everyone typically cares about the same things, but they have different ways of solving them (political differences, tackling bipartisanship).\nFinal Thoughts All in all, I thought that this webinar was a really eye-opening moment for me, since it was the first time I participated in a political discussion forum out of the mainstream media. At large, I agreed with a lot of John Kasich\u0026rsquo;s points, and at the same time know that there are ways to expand upon his ideas to be more inclusive. He\u0026rsquo;s not perfect and neither am I, and by presenting my thoughts here, I hope to be able to spark a more inclusive discussion about problem solving and politics.\n"

        "body": "Brief Updates If you have not yet seen my OCaml Tetris game, please check it out here! It caters to all four colorblind color palattes.\nAccessibility Settings Designing games and other screen-based technologies to be colorblind-friendly is an accessibility setting that is often overlooked. If you go to your phone\u0026rsquo;s accessibility settings these days, you will often find Text-to-speech capabilities or other adjustments to font, like size, as some of the most basic options. Of course, not all of these options are the easiest to implement, and some of these have only recently been included due to advancements in machine learning areas like natural language processing (NLP).\nOn my Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, I have options to enable a Screen reader, some visibility and hearing enhancements, as well as some interaction and touch-based accessibility settings. I am glad to see that within my visibility enhancements, Samsung was able to implement the 4 popular colorblind palattes (Protan, Deutan, Tritan, and Grayscale) and an option for a custom palatte. This was the first phone that I personally owned that included these settings, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that colorblind users were grateful for these provisions.\nOf course, it is understandable that accessibility settings at-large aren\u0026rsquo;t prioritized upon demo release of a product, but it is definitely something that can be easily implemented depending on what colors are used in a product.\nColorblind Settings in Games In addition to large scale software and products used by millions, games are another product in which colorblind color options are important. Some games rely heavily on a players ability to discern between colors for a good player experience. I play the game League of Legends, and among the game settings, there is one to turn on colorblind mode for players who suffer from red-green colorblindness.\n  If any other game, like Tetris, requires a player to discern between colors that may be affected by colorblindness, it definitely would benefit from the inclusion of colorblind accessibility settings. Not only does it increase the potential player base, but it also improves the gaming experience for those who are colorblind.\n(This article is also cross-posted on LinkedIn here.)\n"
