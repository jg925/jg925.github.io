        "body": "Brief Updates If you have not yet seen my OCaml Tetris game, please check it out here! It caters to all four colorblind color palattes.\nAccessibility Settings Designing games and other screen-based technologies to be colorblind-friendly is an accessibility setting that is often overlooked. If you go to your phone\u0026rsquo;s accessibility settings these days, you will often find Text-to-speech capabilities or other adjustments to font, like size, as some of the most basic options. Of course, not all of these options are the easiest to implement, and some of these have only recently been included due to advancements in machine learning areas like natural language processing (NLP).\nOn my Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, I have options to enable a Screen reader, some visibility and hearing enhancements, as well as some interaction and touch-based accessibility settings. I am glad to see that within my visibility enhancements, Samsung was able to implement the 4 popular colorblind palattes (Protan, Deutan, Tritan, and Grayscale) and an option for a custom palatte. This was the first phone that I personally owned that included these settings, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that colorblind users were grateful for these provisions.\nOf course, it is understandable that accessibility settings at-large aren\u0026rsquo;t prioritized upon demo release of a product, but it is definitely something that can be easily implemented depending on what colors are used in a product.\nColorblind Settings in Games In addition to large scale software and products used by millions, games are another product in which colorblind color options are important. Some games rely heavily on a players ability to discern between colors for a good player experience. I play the game League of Legends, and among the game settings, there is one to turn on colorblind mode for players who suffer from red-green colorblindness.\n  If any other game, like Tetris, requires a player to discern between colors that may be affected by colorblindness, it definitely would benefit from the inclusion of colorblind accessibility settings. Not only does it increase the potential player base, but it also improves the gaming experience for those who are colorblind.\n"

This topic was inspired by one of the papers that was introduced during a TA lead lecture of the NLP course I took this past fall semester. (Paper: Model Cards for Model Reporting)\n"
