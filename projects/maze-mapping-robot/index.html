    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Fall 2019, I took the required course for ECE majors: ECE 3400 Intelligent
Physical Systems. This was my first college level robotics course since taking
one trimester of robotics at my high school, NCSSM. After filling out a survey
for team placement, I was grouped with 3 other students in my lab section, a
3-hour Monday evening lab at 7:30 P.M. We worked very well together as a team
of four.</p>
<p>Two teammates eventually focused on the circuitry and the actual
building of the robot (named Axel), and I and another teammate focused on the algorithmic
and signals side of the robot. I thoroughly enjoyed coding the path-planning
algorithm for Axel and figuring out the best way to send/receive signals
between Axel and the base station.</p>
<p>Detailed reports of each lab assignment and milestone are available at the links
below.</p>

<p>The competition was held in the Duffield Hall Atrium on December 10, 2019.
We stayed up until 3:00 A.M. the night before to finish testing Axel.
