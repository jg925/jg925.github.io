        "body": "Description During the fall semester of my senior year, I took the class CS 3110 (Functional Programming). This course aimed to teach the fundamentals of functional programming through the language OCaml. OCaml isn\u0026rsquo;t the most popular and well-documented language, but when compared to Haskell, the other popular functional programming language, it is more beginner-friendly.\nFor the final project, I was able to team up with 2 other classmates who were also fellow members of the BRMB (Big Red Marching Band), and we decided to recreate the game Tetris using OCaml. This project was completed in 3 sprints, and we needed to write at least 1500 lines of OCaml code. To hit this requirement, a good chunk of our code is dedicated to providing colorblind players a good set of color options to choose from so that each piece had a distinct color.\nOur Github repository with the game and any necessary install instructions are available at the link below, and anyone can install and play the game.\nLinks Source Code\nDemo Video   "

        "body": "Description Fall 2019, I took the required course for ECE majors: ECE 3400 Intelligent Physical Systems. This was my first college level robotics course since taking one trimester of robotics at my high school, NCSSM. After filling out a survey for team placement, I was grouped with 3 other students in my lab section, a 3-hour Monday evening lab at 7:30 P.M. We worked very well together as a team of four.\nTwo teammates eventually focused on the circuitry and the actual building of the robot (named Axel), and I and another teammate focused on the algorithmic and signals side of the robot. I thoroughly enjoyed coding the path-planning algorithm for Axel and figuring out the best way to send/receive signals between Axel and the base station.\nDetailed reports of each lab assignment and milestone are available at the links below.\nLinks Published Website Source code\nCompetition Final Round Video The competition was held in the Duffield Hall Atrium on December 10, 2019. We stayed up until 3:00 A.M. the night before to finish testing Axel.   "
