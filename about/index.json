        "body": "Hello! My name is Jinny Gui, and I am a recent graduate from Cornell University. I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) with a minor in Computer Science (CS). I am currently pursuing an M.Eng in CS that will be completed this fall. My interests lie within Computer Vision, Robotics Perception, and a general passion for efficiency and social good through a variety of different projects. Although I have done 3 summers of research with the Computer Systems Laboratory, I am now focused on industry and directly impacting the world around me.\nOutside of class, my interests include music, languages, and gaming (e-sports). I have played the clarinet since 6th grade and have taught myself very basic piano throughout the years. My interest in languages extends to my 4 language tracks on Duolingo. These are: French, Mandarin, Korean, and Danish. Some I use for maintaining my level in those languages (French and Mandarin), others I use to learn (Korean and Danish). As for gaming and e-sports, I am an avid fan of League of Legends and follow Riot Games fairly closely.\n"
