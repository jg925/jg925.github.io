        "body": "Hello! My name is Jinny Gui, and I am a senior undergrad at Cornell University. I study Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and minor in Computer Science (CS). My interests lie within robotics, computer vision, automation, and a general passion for efficiency and social good through a variety of different projects. Although I have done 3 summers of research with the Computer Systems Laboratory, I am now focused on industry and directly impacting the world around me.\nI am currently in the process of applying to the Early M.Eng (Masters in Engineering) program with my school\u0026rsquo;s CS department, which will add 1 extra semester to the end of my undergraduate career. I intend to graduate in December, 2021.\nOutside of class, my interests include music, languages, and gaming (e-sports). I have played the clarinet since 6th grade and have taught myself very basic piano throughout the years. My interest in languages extends to my 4 language tracks on Duolingo. These are: French, Mandarin, Korean, and Danish. Some I use for maintaining my level in those languages (French and Mandarin), others I use to learn (Korean and Danish). As for gaming and e-sports, I am an avid fan of League of Legends and follow Riot Games fairly closely.\n"
