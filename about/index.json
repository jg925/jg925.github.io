        "body": "My name is Jinny Gui, and I am a recent graduate from Cornell University. I just finished my M.Eng in Computer Science (CS), and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) with a minor in Computer Science (CS) in undergrad. Throughout the last 4.5 years, my interests have fluctuated around one singular idea: the ability to help with technology others and do social good.\nCurrently, I am actively working with Inspirit AI as a Curriculum Manager through a contract while also searching for my next job. I spend my time blogging on Medium, practicing coding challenges and honing my algorithmic/data structure knowledge, as well as exploring past interests like Web Development.\nOutside of class, my interests include music, languages, and gaming (e-sports). I have played the clarinet since 6th grade and have taught myself very basic piano throughout the years. My interest in languages extends to my 4 language tracks on Duolingo. These are: French, Mandarin, Korean, and Danish. Some I use for maintaining my level in those languages (French and Mandarin), others I use to learn (Korean and Danish). As for gaming and e-sports, I am an avid fan of League of Legends, and keep up with quite a few Twitch and YouTube streamers.\n"
