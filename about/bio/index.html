    <p>My name is Jinny Gui, and I am a recent graduate from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>. I just finished my M.Eng in Computer Science (CS), and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) with a minor in Computer Science (CS) in undergrad. Throughout the last 4.5 years, my interests have fluctuated around one singular idea: the ability to help with technology others and do social good.</p>
<p>Currently, I am actively working with <a href="https://www.inspiritai.com/">Inspirit AI</a> as a Curriculum Manager through a contract while also searching for my next job. I spend my time <a href="https://medium.com/@jinnygui">blogging on Medium</a>, practicing <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard">coding</a> <a href="https://leetcode.com/">challenges</a> and honing my algorithmic/data structure knowledge, as well as exploring past interests like Web Development.</p>
<p>Outside of class, my interests include music, languages, and gaming (e-sports). I have played the clarinet since 6th grade and have taught myself very basic piano throughout the years. My interest in languages extends to my 4 language tracks on Duolingo. These are: French, Mandarin, Korean, and Danish. Some I use for maintaining my level in those languages (French and Mandarin), others I use to learn (Korean and Danish). As for gaming and e-sports, I am an avid fan of League of Legends, and keep up with quite a few Twitch and YouTube streamers.</p>
